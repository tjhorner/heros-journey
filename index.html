          The hero's journey archetype is included in many stories,
          including the <i>Portal</i> and <i>Half-Life</i> series.

        <p>
          I have covered the elements of the hero's journey in <i>Portal 2</i>
          in the video included below.

        <p>
          After you're done watching that, I have included two write-ups
          below; one is describing the hero's journey in <i>Half-Life 2</i>
          with the other connecting both of these stories back to <i>The Odyssey</i>.

      </div>

      <div class="wow fadeInDown">
        <p>
          <i>Half-Life 2</i> is one of the most critically acclaimed video games
          of all time. It set the standard for graphics, quality, and most importantly,
          story. That's what we'll be focusing on here.
        </p>

          The game starts out with the main character and protagonist, Gordon Freeman,
          on a train about to enter the sinister City 17 controlled by Dr. Breen, who
          we'll meet later.
        </p>

        <h2>The Journey</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="wow fadeInDown">
        <p>
          You end up meeting Alyx, the herald and an ally. She guides you to the mentor,
          Dr. Kleiner. He could be classified as the "old man", although we don't know his
          exact age. He invented a teleportation machine to (theoretically) teleport you
          to Eli Vance's lab.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kleiner's pet, Lamar, destroys the machine on accident and
          Gordon cannot teleport to Eli's lab. This is where he starts his journey. He has
          no choice here, but he does have Kleiner and Alyx to help him as he goes through
          City 17 to Eli's lab.

      </div>

      <div class="wow fadeInDown">
        <p>
          At this point in the story, Gordon knows what his end goal is: get to Eli Vance's
          lab and stop the Combine (which are basically aliens, they aren't important to this)
          from invading Earth. The thing is, he needs to get out of City 17 and traverse the
          half-invaded Earth with him as an entire species' primary target.

        <p>
          Gordon is now tasked with navigating through City 17 and then into the wasteland to
          get to Eli's lab. With tons of enemies on his tail, he meets many allies from the
          resistance on the way.
        </p>

        <p>
          These allies will help Gordon greatly throughout the story, giving him bits of
          information on what happened while he was in a deep sleep.

        <h2>The Final Battle</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="wow fadeInDown">
        <p>
          After Gordon has met many friends and foes, he finally reaches the Citadel, the entry point of
          the Combine. In an attempt to destroy it before he goes to Eli's lab, he hopes to stop more
          Combine from entering and hopefully destroy all of them.
        </p>

        <p>
          He ends up getting caught before he could reach the core and gets trapped. He has a new weapon,
          but doesn't realize it yet. He can use this to his advantage by picking up basically anything in
          the world, including energy balls which he uses as projectiles.

          Gordon escapes the Citadel while destroying it. This leads on to <i>Half-Life 2: Episode One</i>,
          but that's a whole different write-up for next time.

              This happens in many of Odysseus' stories along his journey, one being the
              goddess Circe. She tries to keep Odysseus from returning home by taking
              advantage of him. This creates a boundary, but eventually Odysseus takes
              hold of himself and continues returning home.
            </td>
            <td>
              When GLaDOS is re-awakened, this creates a giant boundary in Chell's way.
              She must solve GLaDOS' tests to escape the facility, but ends up escaping
              with Wheatley without solving the tests.
            </td>
            <td>
              Gordon overcomes many boundaries in the story, one being the broken
              teleporter. This was actually a proponent of his journey in the first place
              as well. He needs to find a way around to Eli's lab -- a detour.

              Odysseus gains many foes along the way, including (but not limited to!) Circe
              (in a way), the cyclops, Scylla, Penelope's suitors, and Apollo. He ends up
              fighting some, but not all of them.
            </td>
            <td>
              Okay, this is a little weird. At first, Wheatley is your ally and mentor. Later
              on, after he gains power, Wheatley turns into a madman (madrobot?) and becomes
              your foe. But then later on, he tries to become your friend again.
            </td>
            <td>
              Gordon has many foes including zombies, Combine, Metropolice, and many more. Way
              too many to cover! But he ends up fighting all of them and possibly wins. We don't
              know yet though, <a href="img/believe.jpg" target="_blank">Valve hasn't released Half-Life 3</a>.
